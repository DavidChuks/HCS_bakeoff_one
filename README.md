Designing Human Centered Software class: 

The class provided source code for a simple application that displays a 4x4 grid of square buttons. These light up one at a time. Users must click the lit buttons as accurately and quickly as they can.  

The mission is to devise a technique that facilitates clicking these buttons (every button must be equally clickable at any instant). Time is the important measure!
